def ode_system(exprs, funcs):
    """Solve a system of ODEs with optional initial conditions.
    For internal use only. The public interface is `dsolve`.
    It crashes or it just has undefined behavior in numerous cases. Check the
    TODOs in this docstring.
    Input arguments
    ===============
    - exprs: a list of expression equated to zero
    - funcs: a list of functions to solve for (should be already applied, i.e.
      `f(x)` and not `f`)
    Initial conditions
    ==================
    Initial conditions are supplied as part of the list of equations. For the
    moment the preprocessor for initial conditions is quite simple, thus take
    care to insure that there are no free variables in the equations
    corresponding to initial conditions.
    Scope and Nonlinear equations
    =============================
    The coupled equations must be linear homogeneous. Equations that can be
    separated from the system can be of any type supported by the single
    equation solver in `dsolve`.
    Which equations can be separated is determined by checking which equations
    concern only a single function. This is simple and not very powerful
    method. It may be possible to extend it using the `solve` function.
    TODO
    For the moment this solver will probably crash on overdetermined
    nonconsistent systems.
    TODO
    It will also crash if the supplied coupled equation are nonlinear.
    TODO
    It will not work either for linear homogeneous systems that can not be
    diagonalized.
    TODO
    Nonhomogeneous linear system do not work either.
    Preprocessing
    =============
    Equations that can be separated (according to the abovementioned method
    used for separation) are not preprocessed and left to the single ODE
    solver. Equation that can not be separated are preprocessed by calling the
    `doit` method.
    Constants of integration
    ========================
    TODO
    As the single ode solve does not care that simplifying the constants can
    destroy information about the coupling we need to turn it off. This is not
    yet done.
    TODO
    Create smarter constant simplification routines.
    Implicit solutions
    ==================
    The single ODE solvers return Equality instances and not mappings for the
    solutions. This is necessary because sometimes an implicit solution
    (i.e. an algebraic equation in the function to be solved for) is easy to
    find and at the same time it is impossible to solve the resulting
    algebraic equation in order to obtain an explicit solution.
    TODO
    Currently this solver crashes if intermediate implicit solutions are
    generated.
    Output format
    =============
    For the sake of consistency with the single ODE solver, results are
    returned in the form of a list of Equality instances:
    - single function to solve for: list of Equations describing each
      existing solution.
    - multiple functions to solve for: list of systems of Equations describing
      each existing solution. The system of Equations is itself a list.
    TODO
    Currently the solver crashes if it needs to produce multiple solutions.
    Internal format
    ===============
    As implicit solutions are unsupported for the moment and as anyway
    supporting them for coupled equations is much more complicated than what we
    have here, there is no reason ot use Equality instances internally. Much
    simpler is to use dictionaries. They are transformend into lists of
    Equations at the end of the function.
    Examples
    ========
    Due to the different possible solutions these are not doctested.
    Check the test_ode_system.py file.
